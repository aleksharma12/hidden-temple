You wander into a narrow tunnel, at the end of which you can just
barely make out a bright light. Knowing your metaphors, but also still
intent upon securing the temple's riches, you press on.

As you emerge from the passage, you are briefly blinded by what appears
to be thousands of torches hovering in thin air. Black magic! You pinch
yourself to make sure you are not having another out-of-body experience.

Ouch. This must be an in-of-body experience, something which doesn't
happen often mostly because the phrase itself sounds dumb when you say
it out loud.

As you reach out towards one of the torches, your hand presses against
something cold and hard. It is only then you realize that this room is
filled with hundreds of mirrors, making it nearly impossible to see
where you are going. This is going to be a bit tricky...
