#Introduction

You are a British explorer seeking fame, fortune, and a decent cup of tea.

Unfortunately, all three of these lie at the center of a temple full of traps!

You must solve a series of puzzles in order to win glory for Mother England,
reduce your student loans, and return home in time for buttery scones!
