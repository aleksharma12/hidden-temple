The Hidden Temple
_________________

You are a daring British explorer, bored with your stupid life
and eager to bring glory to the empire.

A few months ago, you heard about an expedition to a temple
hidden deep in Africa and, because you don't really think things
through, you quickly signed up.

Now, after a harrowing journey involving angry animals, sarcastic
natives, and dumb terrain issues, you have made it to the temple.
All that remains are a series of deadly traps that have claimed
the lives of several other explorers before you.

How hard could it be?
